synopsis: "A Foundation for Formally Proven Schedulability Analysis"
description: """Prosa is a repository of definitions and proofs for
real-time schedulability analysis built with Coq. Prosa’s
distinguishing characteristic is that Prosa prioritizes readability
over all other concerns to ensure that specifications remain
accessible to readers without a background in formal proofs. (A
background in real-time scheduling is assumed.)"""
