(** * Abstract Response-Time Analysis *)
(** In this module, we propose the general framework for response-time analysis (RTA) 
    of uni-processor scheduling of real-time tasks with arbitrary arrival models. *)
(** We prove that the maximum (with respect to the set of offsets) among the solutions
   of the response-time bound recurrence is a response time bound for [tsk]. Note that
   in this section we do not rely on any hypotheses about job sequentiality. *)

    (** In order to prove that R is a response-time bound of job j, we use hypothesis H_R_is_maximum. 
       Note that the relative arrival time (A) is not necessarily from the search space. However, 
       earlier we have proven that for any A there exists another [A_sp] from the search space that
       shares the same IBF value. Moreover, we've also shown that there exists an [F_sp] such that
       [F_sp] is a solution of the response time recurrence for parameter [A_sp]. Thus, despite the 
       fact that the relative arrival time may not lie in the search space, we can still use

    (** In this section, we consider the case where the solution is so large 
       that the value of [t1 + A_sp + F_sp] goes beyond the busy interval. 
       Although this case may be impossible in some scenarios, it can be

        (** Suppose that [A_sp + F_sp] is no less than relative arrival of job [j]. *)
        Hypothesis H_fixpoint_is_no_less_than_relative_arrival_of_j : A <= A_sp + F_sp.
 
        (** In this section, we prove that the fact that job [j] is not completed by 
           time [job_arrival j + R] leads to a contradiction. Which in turn implies
           that the opposite is true -- job [j] completes by time [job_arrival j + R]. *)
        Section ProofByContradiction.
            
          (** Recall that by lemma "solution_for_A_exists" there is a solution [F] 
             of the response-time recurrence for the given relative arrival time [A] 
             (which is not necessarily from the search space). *)

          Hypothesis H_A_F_fixpoint:
            A + F = task_run_to_completion_threshold tsk + interference_bound_function tsk A (A + F).
 
          (** Next, we assume that job [j] is not completed by time [job_arrival j + R]. *)
          Hypothesis H_j_not_completed : ~~ completed_by sched j (job_arrival j + R).

          (** Some additional reasoning is required since the term [task_cost tsk - task_run_to_completion_threshold tsk]
             does not necessarily bound the term [job_cost j - job_run_to_completion_threshold j]. That is, a job can 
             have a small run-to-completion threshold, thereby becoming non-preemptive much earlier than guaranteed 
             according to task run-to-completion threshold, while simultaneously executing the last non-preemptive 
             segment that is longer than [task_cost tsk - task_run_to_completion_threshold tsk] (e.g., this is possible 
             in the case of floating non-preemptive sections). 

             In this case we cannot directly apply lemma "j_receives_at_least_run_to_completion_threshold". Therefore
             we introduce two temporal notions of the last non-preemptive region of job j and an execution 
             optimism. We use these notions inside this proof, so we define them only locally. *)

          (** Let the last non-preemptive region of job [j] (last) be the difference between the cost of the job 
             and the [j]'s run-to-completion threshold (i.e. [job_cost j - job_run_to_completion_threshold j]). 
             We know that after j has reached its run-to-completion threshold, it will additionally be executed
             [job_last j] units of time. *)

             [task_run_to_completion_threshold -  job_run_to_completion_threshold]).
             Intuitively, optimism is how much earlier job j has received its
